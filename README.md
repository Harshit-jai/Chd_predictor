# CHD Predictor
Heart Disease Prediction Using Ensemble Techniques and Explainable AI
### 🔗 Live Demo: [CHD Predictor](https://chdpredictor.streamlit.app/)

### 📌 Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Our CHD Predictor utilizes Machine Learning and Explainable AI (XAI) to predict Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) based on clinical data.

We have trained multiple ML models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, along with ensemble techniques to enhance prediction accuracy. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret model predictions, ensuring transparency in medical decision-making.

## 🚀 Features
✔️ Predicts Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) using clinical parameters

✔️ 11 ML models with ensemble learning for high accuracy

✔️ SHAP Analysis for interpretable AI in healthcare
